<h4>Matrix Completion with Algebraic Variety Models</h4>
<p>
An extension of low-rank matrix completion to the case where the data lies on a low-dimensional algebraic variety. This includes data belonging to a union of low-dimensional subspaces, and other low-dimensional algebraic curves and surfaces.
